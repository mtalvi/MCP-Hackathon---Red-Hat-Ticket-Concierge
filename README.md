# MCP-Hackathon--Red-Hat-Ticket-Concierge
# üõ†Ô∏è Red Hat Ticket Concierge Agent (MCP + LlamaStack)

This project implements a secure, context-aware MCP agent that helps Red Hat employees open the correct internal ServiceNow ticket for common requests like badge access, locker assignment, and payroll support.

## üöÄ Use Case

Employees often struggle to find and fill the correct internal ticket forms across Red Hat's ServiceNow system. This agent streamlines the process by:
- Understanding a natural language request (e.g. "I lost my badge")
- Matching it to a known ticket type
- Prefilling the ticket form fields
- Opening the correct ServiceNow URL in the user's browser (with cookies)
- Leaving the final submission step to the user for security compliance

---

## üß† Agent Capabilities

- Classifies requests using a keyword-based matcher
- Integrates with a ticket catalog (`tickets.json`) of known ticket types
- Uses browser cookies to authenticate the user securely
- Displays ticket data in the terminal and launches the ticket form in the browser
